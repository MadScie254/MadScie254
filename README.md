# üöÄ Hello, I'm Daniel Wanjala!

Hi! I‚Äôm Daniel Wanjala Machimbo, a Data Analyst, IT Manager, and dedicated Data Scientist. I focus on using data to inspire innovative ideas and drive growth. My goal is to leverage data to solve challenges and open up new possibilities.

## üìö About Me

My interest in data started at Zetech University, where I earned a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology. This education gave me a strong understanding of computing systems, network configurations, and software development. My fascination with data analysis grew as I discovered how impactful data could be in addressing real-world issues.

To pursue my passion, I joined Moringa School, where I earned a Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning. This experience introduced me to predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning. It was here that I became skilled in Python, which has since been my preferred tool for data analysis.

Currently, I am advancing my expertise by pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science at Cooperative University Kenya. I am particularly interested in deep learning models and their potential to change various sectors, including healthcare and finance.

## üåü My Data Science Journey

My journey in data science has been about learning, innovation, and making a difference. I aim to turn complex data into clear insights that support strategic decisions. I‚Äôve had the chance to work on meaningful projects that highlight how effective data analytics and machine learning can be.

One key project was creating a Predictive Model for Monthly Total Remittances for the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). This model used time series analysis and machine learning to forecast remittance trends, giving valuable insights to financial analysts and decision-makers. This project pushed me to think analytically and improve model performance.

At Kingdom Hospital, I played a leading role in data integration projects aimed at improving patient care and operational efficiency. By applying machine learning models for predictive analysis, I helped in identifying patient patterns, optimizing resource use, and enhancing service delivery. This role strengthened my skills in healthcare analytics, predictive modeling, and IT management.

I also serve as a Senior IT Manager at Kingdom Hospital, where I oversee the technology infrastructure, ensuring system reliability, security, and performance. I combine my IT management experience with my data science knowledge to contribute to the organization‚Äôs development.

I am currently exploring Neural Networks, focusing on advanced structures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). I am examining their uses in natural language processing, time series forecasting, and predictive analysis. I aim to apply these advanced models to solve challenging problems and develop new solutions.

## üìö Learning and Growth

I am dedicated to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends. I have earned certifications in Data Science from HackerRank and won the Prime Code Champ Contest by Tech Gig. These achievements have enhanced my problem-solving skills and competitiveness.

I am also involved in the data science community by contributing to open-source projects and guiding budding data scientists.
