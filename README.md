# üöÄ Hey there, I'm Daniel Wanjala!

Welcome to my data universe, where numbers are transformed into narratives, and analytics drive every single decision. I am Daniel Wanjala Machimbo, a Data Analyst, IT Manager, and an ever-curious Data Scientist on a mission to use data for innovation and strategic growth. I believe in the power of data to not only solve complex problems but also to create new opportunities.

## üìö About Me

I am a data enthusiast with a vision to shape the future using data-driven solutions. My journey began at Zetech University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. This academic foundation equipped me with in-depth knowledge of computing systems, network architectures, and software development. My curiosity for data analysis was ignited by the endless possibilities that data holds in solving real-world challenges.

To fuel my growing passion for data, I joined Moringa School, where I pursued a Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning. This program was a turning point, exposing me to the power of predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms. It was here that I mastered Python, a powerful programming language that has since become my go-to tool for data manipulation and analysis.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science at Cooperative University Kenya. This advanced academic pursuit is sharpening my skills in neural networks, artificial intelligence systems, and data-driven decision-making frameworks. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of deep learning models in transforming industries, from healthcare to finance.

I am a proud graduate of Zetech University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. My academic journey laid a strong foundation in computing, networking, and system integration. It was here that my passion for data analytics and machine learning began to take shape.

I further honed my skills at Moringa School, earning a Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning. This intensive program equipped me with the tools and techniques to harness the power of data, from data wrangling to advanced predictive modeling. I am also pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Data Science at Cooperative University Kenya, driven by a quest for deeper insights into neural networks, AI systems, and data-driven decision-making frameworks.

## üåü My Data Science Journey

My journey into the world of data science has been a fulfilling quest for knowledge, innovation, and impact. I am driven by a desire to translate complex data into actionable insights that empower decision-makers. I have been fortunate to work on impactful projects that showcase the power of data analytics and machine learning.

One of my most significant projects was the development of a Predictive Model for Monthly Total Remittances for the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). This model utilized time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to forecast remittance trends, providing valuable insights to policymakers and financial analysts. The project challenged me to think critically, analyze complex data patterns, and optimize models for accuracy and efficiency.

In my role as a Data Scientist at Kingdom Hospital, I led data integration projects aimed at enhancing patient care and operational efficiency. By implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics, I was able to identify patient trends, optimize resource allocation, and improve service delivery. This role deepened my expertise in healthcare analytics, predictive modeling, and IT management, solidifying my belief in the transformative power of data.

I am also a Senior IT Manager at Kingdom Hospital, where I oversee the technology infrastructure, ensuring system efficiency, security, and performance optimization. This role demands a strategic mindset and a deep understanding of IT systems, which I continuously integrate with my data science expertise to drive organizational growth.

My passion for data science is matched by my commitment to continuous learning. I am currently diving deep into Neural Networks, with a focus on advanced architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). I am exploring their applications in natural language processing, time series analysis, and predictive modeling. My ultimate goal is to leverage these advanced models to solve complex challenges and innovate new solutions.

My journey into the world of data science has been fueled by curiosity and a passion for turning data into actionable insights. I have had the privilege of working on impactful projects, including developing a Predictive Model for Monthly Total Remittances for the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). This project not only challenged my analytical skills but also enhanced my understanding of financial data systems and economic modeling.

At Kingdom Hospital, I served as a Data Scientist and Senior IT Manager, where I led data integration projects and implemented machine learning models to improve patient care and operational efficiency. This role deepened my expertise in healthcare analytics, predictive modeling, and IT management.

## üìö Continuous Learning and Growth

I am committed to continuous learning, staying ahead of industry trends, and expanding my knowledge. I have earned certifications in Data Science from HackerRank and won the Prime Code Champ Contest organized by Tech Gig. These experiences have reinforced my competitive edge and problem-solving abilities.

Currently, I am diving deep into Neural Networks, exploring advanced architectures like RNNs and LSTMs, and implementing practical solutions using TensorFlow and Python. I am also actively involved in the data science community, contributing to open-source projects and mentoring aspiring data scientists.
