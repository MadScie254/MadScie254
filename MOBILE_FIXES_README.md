# Mobile Compatibility & Button Styling Fixes

## Issues Addressed
1. **Mobile users seeing plain white screen** - Fixed with emergency loading scripts and CSS overrides
2. **Inconsistent button styling** - Standardized all buttons to match the "View My Work" button design
3. **Mobile viewport and touch issues** - Added proper mobile optimizations

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Emergency Mobile Loading Script
- Added critical JavaScript that runs immediately on page load
- Forces visibility of all page elements on mobile devices
- Includes fallback content if main content fails to load
- Fixes iOS zoom issues and viewport problems

### 2. Consistent Button System
Created unified button classes based on the "View My Work" button:

- **`.btn-primary`** - Primary action buttons (gradient background)
- **`.btn-secondary`** - Secondary action buttons (outline style)
- **`.know-more-button`** - Section navigation buttons
- All buttons now have consistent styling, hover effects, and mobile optimization

### 3. Mobile CSS Overrides
- Emergency CSS rules that force proper display on mobile
- Responsive typography scaling
- Fixed container widths and padding
- Ensured all text and backgrounds are visible
- Proper touch targets (minimum 44px)

### 4. Button Styling Specifications
- **Primary buttons**: Gradient from #6C5CE7 to #A29BFE (light) / #66FCF1 to #45A29E (dark)
- **Secondary buttons**: Transparent with colored border
- **Hover effects**: Slight scale (1.03) and translateY(-2px)
- **Mobile optimized**: 44px minimum height, proper padding
- **Consistent icons**: Right-aligned with smooth animations

## Testing
