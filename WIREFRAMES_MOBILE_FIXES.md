# Wireframes Mobile Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed
1. **Poor mobile layout** - Wireframe cards were stacking incorrectly
2. **Aspect ratio problems** - 9:16 aspect ratio was too tall for mobile viewing
3. **Text sizing issues** - Text was too small or too large on mobile
4. **Grid layout breaking** - Cards weren't displaying properly in mobile grid
5. **Stats section cramped** - Statistics were too compressed on mobile

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Mobile-First HTML Structure
- Changed from rigid grid to progressive enhancement approach
- Used `space-y-8` for mobile stacking, then `md:grid` for larger screens
- Added responsive aspect ratios: `aspect-[16/9] md:aspect-[9/16]`
- Added minimum heights to prevent collapsing: `min-h-[200px]`

### 2. Responsive Wireframe Cards
- **Mobile**: Horizontal layout (16:9) for better viewing
- **Desktop**: Vertical layout (9:16) for traditional mobile mockup appearance
- Improved padding and spacing for touch interaction
- Enhanced text sizing with responsive variants

### 3. Enhanced Mobile CSS
```css
/* Force proper backgrounds and visibility */
.wireframe-card {
    background: rgba(247, 247, 247, 0.9) !important;
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px) !important;
    border: 1px solid rgba(108, 92, 231, 0.2) !important;
}

/* Responsive aspect ratios */
.wireframe-card .aspect-[16/9] {
    min-height: 180px !important;
    max-height: 220px !important;
}
```

### 4. Statistics Section Improvements
