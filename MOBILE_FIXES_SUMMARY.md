- **Improved spacing**: Enhanced padding and margins for better mobile readability
- **Fixed overflow issues**: Added proper `overflow: hidden` and `box-sizing: border-box`
- **Grid responsiveness**: Wireframes now stack properly on mobile, use 2-column on tablet, 3-column on desktop
- **Maintained hierarchy**: All text sizes scale appropriately across devices

### ‚úÖ 2. Mobile Display Fixes
- **Enhanced preloader**: Added multiple fallback mechanisms for iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **Emergency content fallback**: Implemented emergency content display for critical mobile issues
- **Viewport optimization**: Added proper viewport handling and prevented zoom on input focus
- **Background visibility**: Forced proper background colors and text visibility on mobile
- **iOS-specific fixes**: Added `-webkit-` prefixes and iOS Safari compatibility

### ‚úÖ 3. Responsiveness Improvements
- **Touch targets**: All interactive elements now meet 44px minimum touch target requirements
- **Orientation handling**: Added landscape mode optimizations for mobile devices
- **Ultra-small screen support**: Special optimizations for screens ‚â§375px width
- **Enhanced navigation**: Mobile menu with improved backdrop-blur and touch accessibility
- **Scroll optimization**: Better scroll behavior and back-to-top button positioning

### ‚úÖ 4. Dark Mode Consistency
- **Mobile dark mode**: Enhanced dark mode switching and consistency across all screen sizes
- **Contrast improvements**: Better text/background contrast ratios for accessibility
- **Wireframes dark mode**: Proper dark mode support for wireframe cards and content
